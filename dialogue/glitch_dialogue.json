He tried pulling the same stunt on me but I swiped his phone while he was breaking up a prison fight and hacked into the camera system, erasing the video of me exiting my cell. I placed his phone back in his pocket like nothing ever happened."},

This world is a really dangerous place for humans, you should try and find a Spirit Portal to return back to your world really soon. I heard if you kill The Robber, a Spirit Portal will open up. Pretty nasty business and I don’t know where that portal will lead, but it sounds like your only option."},
	{"name": "Glitch", "text": "You seem like a nice person and well I’m bored here anyways and promised myself I would turn a new leaf. If you wish, I can temporarily fuse with your soul and aid you on your journey, though only four ghosts can fuse with you throughout your time here."},
